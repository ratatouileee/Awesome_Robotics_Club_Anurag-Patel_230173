I have used Djikstra's algorithm to solve the problem. I have taken the grid to be a 2D array with yellow blocks replaced with 1 and blue blocks rerplaced with 0. I have a direction array which 
contains the four movements allowed. I start traversing the grid from the start position and checking the required conditions the algorithm finds the path to the end and updates the path if there 
is a shorter path.
